# Section 2 

### Lots of important definitions, some of them needs several revisions. Would be worth the time to read up the section again. 

### Financial Year - starts from April 1st to March 31st. Years Abbreviated as FY18-19 to mean the financial year from April 1st 2018 to March 31st 2019. Still a little bit unclear. Gotta work on this when time allows.
